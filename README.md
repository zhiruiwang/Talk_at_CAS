## Slides
The jupyter notebook `Invited Talk at CAS.ipynb` is the presentation slides.  
Opening it on GitHub shows all the code and ggplot graphs in a flat notebook view. If you want to open it in a slide view, you can just go to this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/zhiruiwang/Talk_at_CAS/blob/master/Invited%20Talk%20at%20CAS.ipynb#/). The way to generate the link it is to go to [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and copy the URL of the notebook into the blank, hit `GoÔºÅ` and then click `View as Slides` bottom(in a shape of wrapped present) on the upper-right corner.  
If you want to run the notebook, you have to install Python and Jupyter(recommend install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) as your Python environment), and then follow the instruction of [IRkernel](https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel). Or you can click the `View as Code` bottom(in a shape of `</>`) next to the `View as Slides` in the [previous link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/zhiruiwang/Talk_at_CAS/blob/master/Invited%20Talk%20at%20CAS.ipynb#/). That will render a webpage with all the R code in the notebook, and then you can copy and paste it into your Rstudio and run each line of them.
